                <h3>Sugar Warning:</h3>
                <p> Consuming too much added sugar increases heart disease risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure and inflammation. 
                    High-sugar diets have been linked to an increased risk of dying from heart disease.

                <h3>Dairy Warning:</h3>
                <p> Because dairy products contribute to the overall saturated fat, calorie, and cholesterol content of the diet, they also contribute to increased risk of obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes. 
                    Other studies have shown milk and other dairy products linked to prostate cancer in men and ovarian cancer in women.

                <h2>Sugar Danger</h2>
                <p> Unstable blood sugar can leave you experiencing mood swings, fatigue, and headaches. 
                    It also contributes to cravings, which begins the cycle of false hunger. 
                    By contrast, those who avoid sugar report having fewer cravings while feeling more emotionally balanced and energized.
                </p>
                <p> While you probably know that sugars can affect your body composition, 
                    they can also mess with your skin by contributing to wrinkles and sagging. 
                    After sugar hits your bloodstream, it attaches to proteins. 
                    The mix of these proteins with sugar causes the skin to lose elasticity and leads to premature aging.

                <h2>Dairy Danger</h2>
                <p> A single serving of whole milk can contain more than 20 percent of the recommended daily allowance 
                    of saturated fat. If you consume three servings of whole milk, 
                    youâ€™re already at 60 percent for the day, even before eating any food. 
                    Cheese is even worse: Harvard reports that pizza and cheese are the biggest food sources of 
                    saturated fat in the American diet.
                </p>
                <p> Despite industry claims, a study of more than 12,000 children showed that the more milk they drank, 
                    the more weight they gained, and skim and 1 percent milk actually appeared to lead to more weight 
                    gain than drinking 2 percent or whole milk. 
                    The study also found that replacing soda with milk did not lead to weight loss.
