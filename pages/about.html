                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p> Clean Food is a movement that is hoping to change people's perspective when it comes
                    to food. People are generally unaware what is good for them and what can cause tragic cosequences.
                    They feed their children with sugary sweets and dairy all their childhood and then look surprised
                    when so many diseases appear. 21st century diet needs to be changed as soon as possible or the outcome 
                    will be unfortunate.

                <h2>Our Achievements</h2>
                <p>
                    <li>245 people have lost weight</li>
                    <li>127 people have better health</li>
                    <li>234 people sleep better</li>

                    <li>270 people feel more energized</li>
                </p>
                <p>Every year we motivate numbers of schools to change diets that they offer to the children.
                    Children are more energized, happier and disciplined since their body is filled with the right fuel
                    and doesn't go through flammatory system.
